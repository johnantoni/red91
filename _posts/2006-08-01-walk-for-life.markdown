yesterday me and my other half fast walked a 10k marathon for charity, and boy are we tired.  Heck this morning I was busily trying to insert my oyster card into the underground gates and then tried pushing a tenner in the slot; only then realising how fazed out i feel.

urgh, why did i run most of the way, must of been mad!

anyway photos are online now for your amusement and thanks to everyone who supported us.
