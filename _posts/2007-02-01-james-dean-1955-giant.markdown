For a guy spun into the celebrity maelstrom so fast and with so much talent, James Dean certainly worked with and knew some of the best actors and actresses around.  Was friends with Dennis Hopper, Martin Landau, and produced some of the most remarkable volumes of work many actors would kill for.  <br />
<br />
Had he survived that fateful crash driving his 'lil bastard' who knows where his career would take him, but he will always be remembered; if not for his films but for the aura that surrounds him.<br />
<br />
His legend proves this, be honest, stay strong and keep a healthy attitude to life; even though things might seem gloomy at times, and you can achieve miracles.<br />
<br />
Good advice,
