As a relative newcomer to BarCamp events it was my first time to have a go at Werewolf, alas I seriously flunked.

But for the un-informed, here's the rules:

<blockquote class="important"><b>Werewolf</b><br />a game of deception, paranoia, and mob rule.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A mind game for 8-15 players, in which a vengeful group of villagers must figure out who among them is secretly a werewolf (before itâ€™s too lateâ€¦) Each â€œnightâ€? the werewolves eat a villager, and each â€œdayâ€? the surviving villagers attempt to rid the town of werewolves by lynching one of their own.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Werewolf is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or Seer (a special Villager). There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. Also, the Seer (if still alive) asks whether another player is a Werewolf or not. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game. Werewolves win when there are an equal number of Villagers and Werewolves. Villagers win when they have killed all Werewolves. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accomodate almost any large group of players.</blockquote>
