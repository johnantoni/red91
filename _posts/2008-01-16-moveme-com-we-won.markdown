Move Me, this year's People's Choice winner, beat competition from far and wide to take the number one prize, proving that moving doesn't have to be as stressful as we may think.

In addition to taking the People's Choice crown, it also proved a popular site with the expert panel of judges, winning the Innovative category award announced earlier in January.

Move Me aims to take away the stress of moving house with its free Move Planner. The planner takes everything into account from finding reputable removal firms to who you need to notify of your change of address.

Enjoy!
