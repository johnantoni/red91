If you're like me and you live in a place which has got more than it's share of personal Wireless Networks then your bound to get a bit of interference knocking holes in yours.<br />
<br />
One thing that can make life hard is if everyone else's network is broadcasting on the same channel as yours.  It can be a problem, especially as most people who setup their networks leave them on the default channel, which is fine in itself but can clog things up.<br />
<br />
Think of it like broadcasting your own radio station, you've decided on 97.1 and so has Radio 1.  Ok if you're close to yours, but say Radio 1 has a bigger transmitter than yours, suddenly you have a problem and can't listen to your station.<br />
<br />
However help is available with a tool called MacStumbler.<br />
<br />
It's a free tool available for the Mac which allows you to scan all the networks in your area and show what channel's everyone else is using, this way you can choose a unique channel and see how good your reception is.<br />
