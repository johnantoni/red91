(photo taken at **JUNO** beach in Normandy, France)

In 2006 me & Michelle took a week from work to tour Normandy and visit the war memorials and locations key to Operation Overlord.  It was a very humbling experience that really took home the impact and scale of what people sacrificed for our freedom.

In 2008 we plan to do the same in Belgium and visit Yepres and the fields of World War I


    In Flanders fields the poppies blow
    Between the crosses, row on row,
    That mark our place; and in the sky
    The larks, still bravely singing, fly
    Scarce heard amid the guns below.
    
    We are the Dead. Short days ago
    We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
    Loved and were loved, and now we lie
    In Flanders fields.
    
    Take up our quarrel with the foe:
    To you from failing hands we throw
    The torch; be yours to hold it high.
    If ye break faith with us who die
    We shall not sleep,
    though poppies grow
    In Flanders fields.

    by John McCrae, May 1915

Thank's all,
