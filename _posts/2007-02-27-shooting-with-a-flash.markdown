Had a big chat on the Nikonians forum today trying to work out how to shoot without the flash and picking a wideangle lens for wilderness shots.

Eventually found out how,

<blockquote>Press and hold the flash button (lightinig bolt icon) and rotate the command dial at the same time to the no flash icon ( crossed through lightining bolt). page 18 of Eng user's manual.</blockquote>

I know, I should read the manual with these things but when you get something cool like an SLR camera you just want to get up and go with it and see what happens; it's experimenting that makes it fun.

Next up, had a chat about choosing a wide angle lens for outdoor shots.  

Last year I finally fell into the DSLR market, and bought the D50 Nikon.  Complemented with the 18-55 kit lens (good backup lens and all-rounder), I also bought the 50mm 1.8D lens (great for close-ups and indoors, fast solid and cheap Â£70 ebay); and a speedlight (sb-600, brilliant everytime i use it).

Along with those I also got a couple of filters, UV (new) and spotlight (second hand) mainly to protect the lenses but the UV to knock out the sun.

So next off I started thinking about replacing the kit 18-55 lens, thought about the 24-85, the 18-70 and then started thinking why do I like my 50mm lens so much?

The answer was obvious, it's small, fast, sharp and light.  If your out and about the last thing you want to do is poke a massive lens in someone's face so started thinking about a smaller fixed / non-zoom lens.

Trawled the web, and eventually kept seeing the 20mm F2.8 keepn appearing, with about Â£300 to spend on something compact it fits the bill but i've been told the more powerful 12-24 is better (but at $900+ its way out of my price range).

dunno, catch up with the chat at,
