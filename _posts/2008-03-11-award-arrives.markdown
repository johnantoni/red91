After a lot of heavy hours and insane determination, we all get what we so thoroughly deserve... **Yahoo's Peoples Choice Award!**

Congrat's go to all the team at my new job (moveme.com), my boss Andy, Terry, Andrey, Rob & John, Denny, (me), and all the guys and girls who keep pushing us and patting us on the back when things go golden.

Personally, the stuff I've done here blows my mind; hence the really embarrasing photo (i was excited).

Got a holiday next week to treat my long-suffering fiancee who has sat steadily by, putting up with me over all the hell that is 'release-time'; she's the best and no-one will ever replace her (easily take a bullet for her any day).

Made some seriously good friends here, loving every second.
