Bought some more pragmatic guides, do enjoy those books; they're really well-written and thoughtfully laid out.  The first is a beta book focusing on Computer Science using Python to demonstrate applications.  The second is on testing which I'm gonna read thru today, kettle's on so chat later.

* [Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/gwpy/practical-programming) by Jennifer Campbell, Paul Gries, Jason Montojo, Greg Wilson

* [The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) by David Chelimsky, Dave Astels, Zach Dennis, Aslak Helles√∏y, Bryan Helmkamp, Dan North

XEN-side I requested the IP addresses for the virtual machines & got them approved via RIPE, so I'll start creating them later today to provide as test boxes for client apps.

All the best,
