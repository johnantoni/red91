It's hard to do but these might help,

* [X-Ray](http://www.westciv.com/xray/), a bookmarklet to examine elements within the document model, similar to firebug's 'inspect'.

* [Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/), an http debugger for ie 6/7

* [IE Developer Toolbar](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en), similar in power to firebug but in no way as comprehensive.

* [IETester](http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage), full-blown IE6 standalone browser, finally you can test against IE6 on Vista!
