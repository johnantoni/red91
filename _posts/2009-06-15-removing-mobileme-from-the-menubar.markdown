title: Removing MobileMe from the menubar
category: apple
---

You see that swirly icon that looks like a dog chasing it's tail, that's MobileMe.  Now if it's irritating you and you don't want it any more do this...

Hold down the **command** (apple) key then with the mouse drag it off the menubar, It'll go poof and there you go; job done.
