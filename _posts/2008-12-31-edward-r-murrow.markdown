> Edward R. Murrow (born Egbert Roscoe Murrow; April 25 1908 â€“ April 27 1965) was an American broadcast journalist. He first came to prominence with a series of radio news broadcasts during World War II, which were followed by millions of listeners in the United States and Canada. Historians consider him among journalism's greatest figures, noting his honesty and integrity in delivering the news.
>A pioneer of television news broadcasting, Murrow produced a series of TV news reports that helped lead to the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

After re-watching **Goodnight and Goodluck** which focuses greatly on the McCarthy era and the poison pen that was Communism to many, it's quite enlightening and thought-provoking what he meant by his last words at the 1958 RTNDA Convention.

>We are to a large extent an imitative society. If one or two or three corporations would undertake to devote just a small traction of their advertising appropriation along the lines that I have suggested, the procedure would grow by contagion; the economic burden would be bearable, and there might ensue a most exciting adventure--exposure to ideas and the bringing of reality into the homes of the nation.
>
To those who say people wouldn't look; they wouldn't be interested; they're too complacent, indifferent and insulated, I can only reply: There is, in one reporter's opinion, considerable evidence against that contention. But even if they are right, what have they got to lose? Because if they are right, and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse and insulate, then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost.

>This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box. There is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance, intolerance and indifference. This weapon of television could be useful.

With reality television now so ingrained in many of our lives, the constant voting shows, radio polls and market surveys you can understand what was meant with the last statement.  It has the ability to enlighten and make us grow as well as cloud and consume the better part of our lives.

The same could be said for the internet, but on that level we each have more power to evolve the medium.  To many and to me personally spend a great deal of time developing for the internet and reading more to produce more.  There is such a great deal of things we can learn out of a device that was once only designed to calculate rocket trajectories, with the open-source era and the hackers of our world we are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible and with that television has constantly tried to evolve to keep up.

It may be in future times that the television succumbs to the same fate as radio did years ago, or that it evolves into something more than a single-sided delivery mechanism, who knows.  To people living alone it's that comforting companion thru the harsh times that provides light and comedy where dark exists, to others it's that vast multi-channel jukebox that screams at you with too much content to make decisions difficult.

These are such complicated and tough times, banks are pushed to make a profit, mortgages aren't happening, and constant sales only hide the inevitable.  For many 2009 is going to be tough, debt is going to get higher and for many, harsh decisions will have to be made in order to survive.

But on the lighter side, technology has always pushed forward thru these problems without holding back.  New innovations are constantly evolving and the boundaries holding back progress keep getting weaker, so this new year could harbor some big surprises to what we thought could ever be possible.

We will just have to wait and see, chaos always has a habit of surprising us in some of the most incredible ways.

Happy New Year people, enjoy 2009, it's gonna be a weird one ;-)
