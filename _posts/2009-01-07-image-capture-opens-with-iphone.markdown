Now I've migrated my iPhone over the my MacBook, I had a trouble with **Image Capture** opening everytime I plugged in my iPhone, real simple fix.

With **Image Capture** open, 

* Goto **Preferences**
* Where it says **Camera - When a Camera is connected...** select **No Application**

Also note iTunes Sync will not work when you're iPhone is on Airline Mode.
