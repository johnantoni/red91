title: Fixing parents laptops - DVD drive not found
category: windows
---

Sitting here fixing machine's for my relatives, like a good boy I am.  Done the wifi, now on to rebuilding their XP machines.  Unfortunately a bit of bloatware I uninstalled took out the DVD drive (go figure).  Thankfully rather than manually fixing the registry Microsoft have released a tool to automagically do it.

* [CD / DVD drive not recognised - XP Tool](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060/EN-US/)

Should do the trick.
