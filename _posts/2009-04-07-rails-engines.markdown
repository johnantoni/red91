[Rails Engines](http://railscasts.com/episodes/149-rails-engines)!

With this you can clean up a lot of your code, packaging it into reusable containers you can add-on as needed to future developments.  One simple example is making a add-on kit for all the javascript libraries and plugins you regularly use like **[jquery-kit](http://github.com/indiehead/jquery-kit/tree/master)**.

Good stuff & thanks Ryan for the brilliant screencast.  If you can't watch the video at work, you can look at it in text format at [ASCIIcasts](http://asciicasts.com/episodes/149-rails-engines).

Also recommend peepcode's [Plugin Patterns for Rails 2](http://peepcode.com/products/rails-2-plugin-patterns), it's a good complement to this.
