Still improving my lil' demo apps code I've moved on to create more permalink google-friendly site structures and reading data off RSS feeds.

So in the benefit of others, here's what I found,

"SEO on Rails":http://www.seoonrails.com/ ...nice blog on integrating basic SEO tactics into your rails app, friendly permalinks, url mapping and dynamic metatags.

"Screen Scraping":http://www.rubyrailways.com/data-extraction-for-web-20-screen-scraping-in-rubyrails  ...good in-depth article on screen scraping with Rails, pulling off html data from a target website (e.g. Twitter) to import into your database

"Google / Yahoo Sitemaps":http://www.igvita.com/blog/2006/11/24/google-yahoo-sitemaps-in-rails/ ...excellent article showing how to get your Rails App to create Yahoo / Google compatible sitemaps using the in-built XML features of Ruby.

Enjoy,


John.
