Boy am I beginning to like the guys over at <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/signup?referrer=40880733">Slicehost.com</a> , really good service.  However unlike most hosting companies you have to setup the DNS records yourself, there's no little helper sitting around to automatically create the zone records or anything.

Thankfully one of the guys there pointed me to a quick little guide to help you setup your A, WWW and NS records...

<a href="http://www.usefuljaja.com/2007/4/setting-up-your-domain">DNS Setup</a>, including reverse DNS

Excellent!
