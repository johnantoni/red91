...and already it's been quite a busy week.  Shrugging off the jetlag and putting things in order.  Vegas was quite an experience, enjoyed the darts & poker more than the machines which are just setup to go against you.

Will have to go thru the photo's and post them on my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/indieflickr) account sometime soon, got a tutorial on the way showing how to get Phusion Passenger working with Nginx; birthday on the 19th.

...all the best,
