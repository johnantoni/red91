Found online Scott Gu's blog mentioning the new look of Visual Studio.  

Codenamed ORCAS, it's based around the new Microsoft Expression series of products incorporating CSS2 styling, web standards, new controls and ASP.NET 3.0.  

The actual interface is massively overhauled with what looks like slider panels, moving away from the Delphi interface of late; good ideas abound.

Should be out around August-November 2007, have your checkbooks at the ready.
