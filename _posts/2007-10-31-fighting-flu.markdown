Today I woke up and felt the oncomings of a cold, damn!

So in the interest of being Agile I thought I'd post something to help out others and tackle the beastie head-on.

#### Symptoms

My doctor told me that if you can see little white patches or blotches on the inside roof of your mouth it denotes a possible viral infection.

Add to that a dull stinging feeling in that area and it's probably the first signs of a cold.

#### Why do I have a fever ?

If your sweating a lot don't worry, it's your body's way of tackling a viral infection.  What happens is your body heats up to induce your anti-bodies to work harder, hence you sweat more.

Drink plenty of fluids, orange squash (better than plain water) to combat this and keep your brain lubricated.

Dehydration leads to headaches as your essentially drying out your poor little brain cells.

#### Paracetamol + Caffeine

Most drugs these days like Anadin Extra or equivalent contain a small amount of caffeine, this is used to speed up the body's absorbtion of the drug and work your anti-bodies harder.  

Not a bad thing, just don't overdo it with the coffee otherwise your heart will be unhappy.

#### Chocolate... Very Good!

My best cure is simply Lemsip and Hot Chocolate, and if you feel like it Marshmallows!

It takes on average 5 minutes for the body to absorb chocolate plus it's pure energy for the little [Sonny Chiba's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Chiba) to fight the bad boggie boys.

Plus it makes you feel good, just remember to brush your teeth ;-)

#### Pointers + Tips

The easiest way to fight a bout of the Flu or a nasty Cold is to hit it head-on before it really takes hold.

* Take paracetamol when it starts
* Hydrate! (always wanted to say that)
* Take Vitamin C to feed your anti-bodies
* Try to get to bed early if you can
* Chicken soup always good

Also if you've got a runny nose use tissues to blow your nose and prevent sneezing.  Last thing you want to do is spread it around the office, on your keyboard, ipod, etc. (it'll happen though).

Plus dispose of the infected tissue paper daily (via toilet, trash can) to make sure the virus doesn't linger around the premises and spread to others.

It's a virus so treat it like one, head on and with no mercy!

Take nice hot baths to burn it out (note the point about heat speeding up your anti-bodies) and relax.

Showers are ok but Radox + Hot Baths really work.

Also curry's and hot food also tend to work in burning out the virus.

#### Final Note

Above all take care, don't overdo it and just put your feet up with a good movie; it is halloween after all.
