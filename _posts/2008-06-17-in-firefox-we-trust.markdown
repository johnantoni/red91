After many months of hard work on behalf of the Mozilla corporation, and lots of testing and fixes from so many smarties; Firefox 3 has finally and officially gone gold.

Better standards compliance, security, memory fixes, just tons and tons of new improvements (not to mention the new rendering engine), this one's a goodie.

Go download it now, Ghandi would be proud ;-)
