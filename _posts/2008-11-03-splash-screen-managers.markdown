Wanted to change the default splash screen on Ubuntu, thankfully found a good GUI tool to do this for me,

    sudo apt-get install startupmanager

After changing your settings it'll want to rebuild the kernel and play with your menu.lst file (obviously), safest I've found so far but do use sparingly.
