Trashed my Fedora 9 install with their latest kernel update 2.6.25, it really is unstable.  So now downloading Fedora 8 Unity, hopefully that'll make it a little more stable.  One thing though, unlike other distributions who use ftp or torrent downloads, the Unity project use Jigdo to handle their iso downloads.

This can be added to your Ubuntu install with,

    sudo aptitude install jigdo-file

Then start the program,

    sudo jigdo-lite

Now I copy & paste the jigdo repository link into Terminal from [here](http://spins.fedoraunity.org/unity/fedora-unity-re-spin-f8-20080501-jigdo), hit enter and it shows a list of possible **iso** files to download, select 64-bit and off it goes.

I'll burn that to dvd and get it on the box soon, can't believe fedora 9 was that unstable!
