God what a week it's been, what with too many late nights, an unexploded bomb outside my station and a million email's asking for help; I think I really deserve that bottle of JD sitting on the counter.

... Anyway, enough of my moaning, to work people and today's task is to build a production-class ruby-on-rails application with Mephisto.  Now if you don't know, Mephisto is a ruby app much like Wordpress that provides you with the basis of running your blog-on-rails.

To build Mephisto, first you'll need to do a couple of things,

First, install ruby, rails, mongrel and the like <a href="http://www.red91.com/2007/05/13/build-your-own/">(see previous guide)</a>

On my ibook (macbook's in the shop getting repaired)

1. open cocoamysql, and create a database called 'mephisto'
...if your following from the previous guide where we built mysql on our machine you'll need to set the host -> 'localhost', username -> 'root', there is no password, so leave the rest blank and cocoamysql should connect to your local db server.

2. open terminal, it'll drop into your user root dir, that's fine, type
<blockquote>svn co  http://svn.techno-weenie.net/projects/mephisto/trunk mephisto</blockquote>
...that'll download the latest build of mephisto and copy it all to the dir 'mephisto'

3. type,
<blockquote>cd mephisto
svn update</blockquote>
...first changes you to the mephisto dir, next verifies the svn version num so your running bleedin' edge material

4. type,
<blockquote>rake rails:freeze:edge
sudo gem install tzinfo --remote</blockquote>
... the first makes rails use the edge gem (required), the next installs the tzinfo gem (for this you have to append 'sudo' to the beginning to give it admin privelidges otherwise it can't install tzinfo on your mac)

5. next go to mephisto/config/ and rename 'database.example.yml' to database.yml

6. edit database.yml, changing the 'production' database name to 'mephisto'

7. open terminal again, type cd mephisto, and run 
<blockquote>rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=production</blockquote>
...this makes sure the production database is used.

8. run,
<blockquote>script/server --e</blockquote>
...to get the Rails web server going.

9. open your web browser and login to your administration at 'http://0.0.0.0:3000/admin' with the username: admin and password: test

In the end, you should now have a fully running Mephisto install, go play!

All the best,
