2007 looks to be a good year, but i still can't wait to open my presents!!!, now all sitting under our christmas tree ;-)  I always loved it when my mum used to put all my pressies in a sleeping bag at the end of the bed when i was little, really made christmas right; hope my girlfriend does the same.

Anyway onto the major topic, BETA Exams.  As you know every now and then Microsoft sends out invitations to MCP graduates to help them out in testing their new stuff before it hits the public, one of these is beta exams.  If your an MCP graduate and have gained some kind of certification I suggest you sign up at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcp/default.mspx">MCP site</a> to get offered to beta test new stuff.

The beta exams are offered for free with a coupon microsoft will supply you in an email and if you pass you get the actual qualification.  So pass the 71-445 and it becomes an official 70-445 and gets added to your testing transcript, well done.

Be warned though, they're much tougher than the usual ones but if it's free then your not really losing anything by applying, you can only gain; so win-win scenario.

Also I hear a rumor that if you keep taking beta exams they'll offer you again, so again it's a worthy exercise, and it's FREE!

I've done that, Microsoft sent me two offers, one for 71-445 and one for 71-446; both Business Intelligence exams giving me credit towards a very cool MCITP qualification in BI (aka Microsoft's version of SAP).

First one is tomorrow with the next on January 3rd; with only one book available to study BI i'm revising my ass off to pass, but it being a beta there's no official course material available, until FEB / APRIL 2007 but i'm trying my best.

God, it would be so cool to pass, BI is so where I wanna be.

Wish me luck, have a great christmas and new year!
