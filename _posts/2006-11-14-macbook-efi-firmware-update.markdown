title: MacBook EFI Firmware Update
category: apple
---

Today Apple released a new firmware update for the MacBooks in a hope to finally end the shut-down issues plaguing a lot of people (going to sleep and having to hit the power for 4-seconds, you know the ones).<br />
<br />
Well F.Y.I. this blogger has installed the firmware update and it flashed ok.&nbsp; Took ages and forced me into cold sweat but it re-booted and i'm typing this post now on said machine.<br />
<br />
I know others are having problems here and there so all I can say is take caution on this one and I just hope it works for you.<br />
<br />
Detailed explanation of what happened:<br />
<ul><li>i installed it via 'system update'</li><li>asked for sys password to install</li><li>then asked to shutdown.&nbsp; all ok.</li><li>i restarted by hitting the power button</li><li>it rebooted into safe-mode to flash firmware</li><li>started flashing but paused a lot for 0-40% (long hangs from 5% 10%, etc)</li><li>jumped from 40% to 70% then long hangs again from 75% 80% etc, (4sec each)</li><li>finally completed 100%, then immediately shutdown and re-booted on it's own.</li><li>started up apple osx and said 'firmware flash finished'</li><li>all ok.</li></ul>I wanted to post this partly as a warning, things should go ok for you but the long pauses at the start and end are worrying (could be verifying data blocks?) otherwise go ahead.<br />
<br />
Will let you know if anything happens from now on in.<br />
<br />
all the best,
