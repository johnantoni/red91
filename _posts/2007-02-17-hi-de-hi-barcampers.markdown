Hi all, me and Michelle are blogging live from <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCampLondon2</a> at the BT towers at St Pauls, London.  Got some really excellent people here, free food, coffee and wifi courtesy of BT, O'Reilly TorchBox and BBC Backstage.

The whole event lasts 2 days, so we've packed our sleeping bags and laptops and looking forward to making some cool new friends.

Presenting in about 2 hours on Learning & Teaching via Web 2.0

Yeeehaw!!!
