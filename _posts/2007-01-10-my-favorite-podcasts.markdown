For christmas I decided to reward my exam efforts with one of the brand new 8gb Ipod Nano's, mainly for songs but more-so for the podcasts.<br />
<br />
I've been listening to a lot lately and find them so much more accessible than the printed form (also a bit more tree friendly), and have managed to cut them down to the ones below:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li><a href="http://www.filmspotting.net/">Filmspotting.net</a><br />for upto the minute news on what's new to watch</li><br />
<li><a href="http://mcpmag.com/webcasts/mcpradio/">MCP Radio</a><br />the best source for the latest news from microsoft</li><br />
<li><a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails Podcast</a><br />best source for good ruby info</li><br />
<li><a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,32549,00.html">The Knowledge</a><br />from the Times online, roundup of all the latest news</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.uptothetopfloor.com/main/">Up To The Top Floor</a><br />From the makers of Tips from the Top Floor about Business</li><br />
</ul><br />
<br />
Just open up ITunes and hunt for the relevant title, i've set mine to keep only the one's I haven't listened to yet.<br />
<br />
All the best,
