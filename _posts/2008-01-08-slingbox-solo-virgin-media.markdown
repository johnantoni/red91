New toy arrived today, the Slingbox Solo.

This is a cool little device that basically allows you to stream any AV source across the internet, and is perfect for watching tv wherever you happen to be.

Here's how it works.

* unpack your slingbox solo (bought from amazon.co.uk).
* connect the slingbox to your broadband router, via the supplied ethernet cable.
* use the scart passthru connector to connect your ntl / virgin / etc. box to your TV, and plug the composite cables into your slingbox's IN ports.
* plug in the supplied IR cables and rig them top & bottom to your cable's IR port (the LED you aim your remote at).
* turn it on, download the software from the slingbox website and your away!

Basically it takes over your cable / av source mimicking what the remote would normally do, then streaming the video across the web to whatever receiver you happen to use; your laptop or mobile phone via the Slingbox software.

The Slingbox Solo allows you to stream one AV source at Â£119; and considering you can give your friends overseas access to your box, suddenly your Eastenders-Hungry cousins can finally get their fix.

Awesome tool.
