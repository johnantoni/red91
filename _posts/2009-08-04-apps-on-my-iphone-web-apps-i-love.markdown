title: Apps on my iPhone + Web Apps I Love
category: apple

It's difficult keeping the amount of apps you put on your iPhone down to a minimum, I mean, do you really need 3-5 pages of apps?

So here's my offering of the iPhone Apps I really use and enjoy;

* Brushes
* Currency
* Evernote ...got the premium edition, really well worth it
* Facebook ...i hate logging into the web-based one
* Flight Control ...keeps Michelle amused
* Pocket God ...silly game but always gets new features
* SaiSuke ...syncs multiple google calendars
* Stanza
* Things ...beats BaseCamp :-)
* TweetDeck ...more powerful than Twitterific
* WordBook
* 1Password Pro

So on the same lines, what premium Web Services do I love using too?

* Evernote ...just awesome & totally addictive!
* Flickr ...like Evernote only more public
* Freshbooks ...accounting made web 2.0!
* Github ...ok, Unfuddle is better but it's more expensive
* Linode ...better than Slicehost (32-bit images FTW!)
* Shoeboxed ...digitizing receipts easily

Ok, for the iPhone I could add Remote, Dopplr, etc. but you've really got to cut it down to 2 screens otherwise it just gets bloated.

...and I admit 37signals stuff is great, just a little expensive (be better if it was $20 or less like others)
