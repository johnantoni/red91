Or otherwise known as, Tips I've Learn't from Last-Minute Travel.

Being a person who loves to travel, i've been around.  Mexico, Seattle, SF, Canada, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, France, Belgium, Italy and couple other places i can't remember.

And during that time i've picked up a few tips that might help other budding road-trip lovers.

First off is travel light.

Now if your going to be dashing from place to place, and don't want much hassle, only pack what you really need.  If it's going to be long distances and quick intervals then try and limit what you take, substitute Electric Toothbrush for disposable one (tesco), huge bottle of aftershave to tiny atomiser (boots), large stick of toothpase to small stick, you get the idea.  If you don't desperately need it and you know the hotel will probably have an equivalent (shampoo & conditioner) then don't pack it.  I mean, the last thing you need is your RedKen or Eau Du Toilette leaking all over your nice new Diesel jeans; or worse, getting customs stop your bag cos it's vibrating and could be explosive (electric toothbrush).  Not that that has happened to me, nearest thing i've had is a bottle of Orange Juice leak all thru my bag, hell to get rid of and always sticky afterwards.  

So if you don't absolutely need it, don't pack it.  Do what the military do, pack everything you need to get the job done; but not the kitchen sink.  OK, I know this rule doesn't apply to females, but it makes my life a bit easier (i just end up buying her expensive presents, which always gets her happy).

Next off, do the same thing with you wallet & keys.  Ask yourself, "do you need to take all your keys with you on the trip?", do you need your bike-lock key, your door keys, your car keys, flashlight, memorystick, etc.  Can't you leave a couple at home, maybe with friends so you can pick them up on the way back?.

Trust me, it helps and will save you a lot of stress so your not worrying on your trip "has someone nicked my keys!....?", you want to be enjoying your trip, not worrying about things like that.

Next off your wallet, do the same, do you need all your cards?, can't you leave some at home?, and those receipts will you really need them in that restaurant in Bali or Quebec?.  All of this seems simple but can take a lot of pressure off you and make your life much easier and more focused on what you need to do, and that is enjoying yourself.

Ok, pack the important things, like drivers licence, passport, cash, credit card, mobile top-up card, but other things like your tesco club card or library card won't be needed (unless you'll still be in the UK and may want to hire a book in Scotland while there?).

Next off, pack a flashlight, and a mini-leatherman.  Theyre good to have and always come in handy (toe-nail clipping, finding the light switch) and well worth it.  Just don't pack the leatherman in your hand luggage, security don't like it and if worst comes to the worst, your flight crew should have something a bit better if needed.  I remember after 9/11 hearing about that airline pilot who announced to his passengers before leaving "now don't think about storming the cockpit, it's reinforced steel and i've got a nice big shotgun and a mug of cocoa so we should have any problems"; that was so funny and exactly what the public needed to hear, screw alqieda(?) i just wanna live my life and enjoy it.

Anyway, hope all that helps, and another thing.

Customs...

Here's a handy tip, when going thru nothing-to-declare remember they always pull up single people with no luggage (why would you go on a trip and have no clothes?), couples are ok.  Also if you have overdid it with the Amex card, just remember to talk about putting the kettle on and checking the post while walking thru and you should be fine.

So don't break any rules, try to keep out of harms way, and above all, Enjoy yourself!
