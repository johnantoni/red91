![Michael Sheen](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2007/05/02/blair460.jpg)

From dashing to meet people, the tube and my phone ringing like it's possessed, to discovering the premiere of **The Damned United** and meeting Michael Sheen it been some kind of crazy day.

Michael was quite a nice guy to talk to, well spoken and charismatic; I hope the film does well for him.  Looking back I remember seeing Brian Clough on tv as a kid with my parents, however I was never that into football as the lure of film-making and it's creative process always took hold of me, but I will definitely give this film a look, anything with Timothy Spall's got to be good (he was great in **Shooting the Past**).

Hope things are great in your part of the world.
