Well if you know I've spent the past 2-3 months putting together a neat little rails app called "AtomPad":http://red91.com , it's really my take on BaseCamp and is a perfect platform to test my Ruby skills and sharpen my OOP mentality.

So far it's proven to be pretty useful and today I've re-written the Reminders and Lists area to be a bit more AJAX powered.  So now you can add, delete, even live-edit items right on the screen just by hovering over them; and all without one single refresh.

Plus you get version control so it records what things you change to your notes, so eventually if your in a team it'll tell you who changed what, when and maybe why (eventually).

Very intelligent, very powerful and so damn cool.

AJAX + Prototype is most definitely king!
