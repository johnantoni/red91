##### Design Pointers

![Andy Clarke](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/91/277856242_60a9d9ee17.jpg)

Attacking Andy's [Transcending CSS book](http://transcendingcss.com/) book while Michelle watches [cranford](http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/cranford/), prefer [Jane Eyre](http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/janeeyre/episodeguide.shtml) myself.  Here's some thought-provoking bullet points I managed to put together thru the process.

** Content Layout **

* Optimize the content order with or without styles
* Semantic is Meaning
* What does the content tell you?
* Follow a content-based process
* Define the source order of the content
* Think about how that content will look without style; will it be easy to read, and will the order make sense
* Visually highlight any relationship: this will ultimately help identify necessary divisions and show areas of similar but not related information
* Use established naming conventions
* Tables are good for tabular data, not your overall layout

** Pointers **

* Create reusable code
* Keep your <div> elements to a minimum
* Ensure your markup stays valid
* Choose positioning over floats
* Organize your CSS

** Design **

* Emphasize columns with colors
* Introduce mood boards
* Keep a design scrapbook
* Designing is more than creating attractive visuals

** Grids **

* Grids helps designers create arrangements and patterns that 'feel right' and that people find comfortable to use
* Grids serve as a guide to designers to follow when they are placing objects on a page.  They provide structure and add rhythm to a design.  Using them helps designers create compositions that are easier for a reader to scan.  Grids also present information in a way that is more neatly organized and therefore easier to follow
* Designing with grids helps usability and accessibility

** Em **

* An **em** is a 'relational' unit of measurement, which, when used on the Web, will change when a visitor either increases or decreases the default text size in her Web browser.

** User Interface Design Principles **

* Know who your user is
* Borrow behaviors from systems familiar to your users
* Let the user see clearly what functions are available
* The behavior of the program should be internally and externally consistent
* Changes in behavior should be reflected in the appearance of the program
* Provide both concrete and abstract ways of getting a task done
* Some aspects of the UI attract attention more than others do
* A user interface is a kind of language -- know what the rules are
* Understand the different kinds of help a user needs
* Let the user develop confidence by providing a safety net
* Limit user activity to one well-defined context unless there's a good reason not to
* Create a program of beauty
* Recruit help in spotting the inevitable defects in your design
* Listen to what ordinary people have to say

##### Transcending CSS

Andy Clarke's book 'Transcending CSS' is awesome and is part my inspiration for this article.  There's also a DVD to accompany it to speed up your learning which you can get from [here](http://transcendingcss.com/).

Great stuff
