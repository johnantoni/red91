Wanted to get the HP back in play so put Ubuntu 9.04 on it to try it out.  

Replaced the drive with an OCZ SSD drive, certainly is quick, boots in 5 seconds.

Anyway what can I tell you;

* There's now a nice windows-esque full screen installer, with the ubuntu ibex wallpaper in the backgroud
* mousepad double-tap is disabled by default, YES!
* You've got the latest software, obviously
* There's new packages like firmware-utils, usbutils, also noticed some nvidia and ati packages installing there in the background.
* The wifi support looks much more competent
* With VLC, the display speed does seem a lot quicker and there's no annoying DVD stutter from the get-go

The kernel is 2.6.28-8 at time of writing, and thru the installer it gives you better options to encrypt your home drive.

Stability on my Alpha 4 version is more or less rock-solid, I wouldn't run a server on it but it should do just fine for my homework laptop.  VLC did just crash with some dvd menu's, but then it's never been too happy with those.

Think i'll be sticking with this one, will update as the experience progresses, but so far thumbs up dev-team and all the supporters; definitely an xp killer.
