Seriously, how good is this Linux distribution.  It's on a rolling release so you never need to worry about release numbers (7.04, 8.10, etc.) and it's so light and tightly put together, just excellent.

I installed a dual-boot install on my new HP laptop with Vista + ArchLinux using GRUB in about 5 minutes, really impressed about the intelligence of this build; well done to all involved.

Also for learning Linux it's got to be the best one to choose, ok it's a toughie with it's command-line install but with a 120mb install and creation of a rescue system incase you screw it up I've seriously grown to like it a lot; totally my favourite Linux distribution.
