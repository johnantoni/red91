Back when I was beginning my career my Dad took me to one side and said 'son, when you write software it's best to not comment stuff so people won't steal your ideas...'.  It sounds a good notion, but thinking back on what my dad said i've got to disagree...

In business, and especially in life, people respect you more and react to you better if your truthful to them first-hand.

You're sure to gain the respect of someone, even if you have muffed up, if you just turn around and say 'sorry, i screwed up', trust me, they may be a bit ansy right away but they'll respect you more if your open and just say what's got you stuck or what's bringing you down rather than bottling it up.

My old boss always told me she never minded the emails I sent her, it was always good to be in the know, but if anything is slipping just tell her, don't bottle it in, two heads are better than one.

Think of the movie 300, in that Leonidis's followers all had the utmost of trust and belief in their leader; whatever the circumstances.  That sort of devotion and trust can't be bought with bonuses or fancy cars, it has to be earned.

Be polite, open and genuinely honest and you just can't lose.

Nobody ever got famous throwing a paddy or shouting at someone, and if someone does that to you just remain calm, concise and passive, don't react to their aggression and feed their anger; it will pass, people can't remain angry for too long, it's just not good for them.

P.S.
below are some links to more cool stuff i've found on the web,
