On the cards today is...

* Finish reading Dave, Chad & Andy's book [Ruby 1.9](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9), upto page 76, need to finish that today.
* Go thru the final [peepcode](http://peepcode.com/) videos I purchased and really nail the topics.
* Setup a short-film site, shoot some reels tomorrow.  Edit in FinalCut and publish over the weekend.  Will need to research the video conversion process, weigh in the different methods, screen size, streaming rate etc.

The third is more for me, I've been talking to Michelle about doing a short-film course, sounds great but the fear is I'll do it, enjoy it and then never touch it again.  Like most things it needs to be ingrained into your psyche to really stick, most of my idols started this way shooting short films before even attempting a course so it's a wise move to go that way.
