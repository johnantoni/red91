<span class="important">Wound My Heart With A Monotonous Languor</span><br />
Always wanted to go there and now me and Michelle are off to Normandy in a months time.

Its all planned, majorly her work, but it is my birthday and I am the one driving; on the wrong bloody side so could be pretty interesting.

Sights on the agenda are the <em>Normandy beaches</em>, <em>Pegasus bridge</em>, <em>Sainte Mere Eglise</em> and the surrounding countryside.

Weve got 5 days and lots of maps.

Cant wait!
