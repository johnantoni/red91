On a non-server note, Michelle has finished her drawing of [Patrick Dempsey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Dempsey) (star of Greys Anatomy and a heart-throb of her's); boy she's getting good at this!

Original is online at my [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/indieflickr/2728815059/) account, well done honey!

She want's to re-do the [Joker](http://www.flickr.com/photos/indieflickr/2715436750/in/photostream/) though, she can make him so much more scarier ;-)
