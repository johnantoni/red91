Brilliant, by now you should have a domain name setup (e.g. red91.com, the www is a sort of alias so don't worry about that, you should be able to access it via http://www.red91.com or http://red91.com).  A place to store your files and be able to access your two (or one) supplier's admin areas, along with php &amp; mysql support available (one for scriptable files and one to store your posts and data).

Now we're going to talk about building your actual site contents.

So by now you've probably decided on what you'll want to use it for,  we'll run through two setup scenarios next; one for static html files and one for installing a blogging system with Wordpress to handle your content.

As a beginner i'd recommend installing Wordpress (http://www.wordpress.com) as it's a very versatile content management system (CMS), gives you portal technology (widgets, drag-n-drop content) and has tons of plugins for lots of different services (flickr photo gallery, del.icio.us links bar, technorati toolbar, google sitemaps, etc.).  Also as an open-source product it's free and you get the source code so you can do whatever you like with it, also you can add-on different themes 'site designs' quickly and easily there are thousands already available pre-built and ready to use.

But first let's run with the scenario you just want to host static html files.

Now what you'll need is an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) program to upload your files to your virtual server in cyberspace.  There are a lot of different types available, with free alternatives so you don't need to open your wallet again.  Stuff like CuteFTP (windows), Transfer (Mac) are two very powerful FTP programs and give support for the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) protocol for more secure file uploads (but the SFTP protocol has to be already provided by your file hoster for this to work, textdrive.com do this).  You'll find support for FTP uploads &amp; downloads in most good web design packages like Dreamweaver, Frontpage, Flock (don't know), Nvu (free) and many others so google some reviews to find the one that's best for you.
