Thanks Adobe very much, I go out and buy your software because I'm obsessed with it's incredible features, and bingo you get slapped by an annoying error message you have no idea what it means.

Probably a lesson in user experience there.

Anyway short answer, on a MAC, is this:

Goto the Root of your System drive, then navigate up to...

    /Library/Preferences/FLEXnet Publisher

And delete the folder, It'll destroy the FLEXnet service which for me was pretty broken, and when you fire up your Adobe package it'll re-init the Licensing Activation process.

FLEXnet by the way is the software Adobe uses to handle licensing for their packages.

Just wish someone would come up with a decent Illustrator alternative to Adobe's product's or at least give them a competitor.

Feck!
