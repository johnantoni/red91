Ron Moore's writing has always astounded me, he always delivers good stuff.  The plot twists aren't staggered too long and the show always tries to attempt something daring that for anyone else might've got them pulled off-air (suicide bombers, drug abuse).

I have to say I enjoyed the finale, everything just came together and made sense; it'll be interesting to see if Lost can do the same.
