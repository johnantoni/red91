Last night I pushed Michelle to go see a film I've been wanting to see ever since I heard about it, *Michael Clayton*.

Basically the story is set around the life of a guy who is really just a janitor, cleaning up the mistakes of others and making sure the people he represents cn continue with their everyday lives; that is until someone misinterprets what he does, thinking he's just some nobody and goes against him.

Excellent acting by all the cast involved and a really thoughtful script, every set piece and action portrayed has meaning; good powerful performances and sometimes brutal storytelling.  But it's realistic and shows you without any messing around what really happens.

It's a slow burner but the ending hit's you like a stack of bricks, perfect, excellent; and possibly the best film I've seen in a long long while.

5 out of 5, an instant classic!
