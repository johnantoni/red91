Two parcels in the post today, one a massive 250gb WD Scorpio drive and the other MAC OSX Leopard.

Perfect end to a not-so-nice week, caught a virus; ended up feeling like an extra from Outbreak; the more you don't know the better ;-)

Anyway,

### Choosing a Hard Drive ?

Obvious question, what do you need?

#### Specs

Well the MacBook drive is an SATA 2.5" drive, so make sure it's:

* SATA = Serial ATA
* 2.5" = in height
* Max Size you'll get = 250 GB

#### Where From ?

You can buy these from any online computer store, I used [OverClockers.co.uk](http://www.OverClockers.co.uk) but any decent retailer or Amazon should have some.

Go with the courier delivery as it's an extra protection and in the event of failure, you've got some fallback ground.  Worth the Â£8 more. 

#### Brand ?

Next off what brand?

Well I've been always partial to Western Digital but most any brand will do, I haven't had much luck with Seagate in the past but they're all pretty much the same. 

The standard drive is by Toshiba so that maybe good, just make sure you don't compromise; you only want to be doing this once.

### Replacing the MacBook Hard Drive

Replacing the hard-drive on my MacBook wasn't that tough.

* You will need a TORX screwdriver (T-8 I think), nip down to your local car mechanic and they'll have one.
* Next flip over you MacBook and use a coin to turn the screw and release & remove the battery.
* Now touch the metal base inside the macbook to discharge any static electricity (do this every now and then to be sure).
* Next unscrew the three protection screws holding the L plate in.
* Carefully remove the L plate.
* Now you have access to the two memory bays and the hard drive bay (located under the battery screw).
* You'll see a white tab holding you hard-drive in, pull it gently to release and slide out your macbook's drive.

Be Careful to only touch the sides of the drive, not any circuitry.  silicon and human moisture do not mix!

* With the drive now out, use the TORX screwdriver to remove the 4 retaining screws holding the drive chassis in place.
* Now remove the drive, replacing it with your new drive, screw back in the retaining screws.
* NOTE: Don't screw them in too hard either you will ruin the thread, just enough to be a good fit.
* Slide the drive back in with the connectors pointing towards the battery screw.
* Should go in snugly, don't need to force it.
* Now put back the L plate
* Screw back in the 3 retaining screws of the L plate (might need to use a mini-screwdriver to push in the little anti-static sponges).
* Put your battery back in and use the coin the lock it in place.

All Done...

* Now the scary part, turn it on.
* You should see a Folder icon, this tells you there isn't an O/S present for it to start.
* Slide in the Leopard DVD and wait for it to boot.
* The disk may take a few minutes to realise what it is but after you should be ok.
* Enjoy your handiwork!

ABOVE ALL AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES RUSH THIS!

It's a good machine and deserves a little bit of care and attention when replacing it's innards, rushing around and bodging the job isn't nice.

### Enjoying Leopard

God if only Vista was as easy to install, stick dvd in, wait, yes i'm english, here's my wifi, yep install, done...

The effects and presence is just startling, it's like Tiger only really well polished!

I also seem to remember Apple mentioning Leopard has SUN 11's VFS (Versioned File System), so self-healing files is in-built; no more corrupted files ever!

Auto Preview folders definite plus and Screens.

It just looks and responds so much better.

Well done Apple, all software should be this easy to setup, I'm not a fanboy; I just believe in making the developers life a little easier.

Plus it comes with Ruby 1.8.6 out of the box!

Cool.
