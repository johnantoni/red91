At the beginning of the year I decided to solidify my PHP skills with sitting the Zend PHP 5 exam.  However soon after, work took over and so this was put back.

I did do all the revision but never got the time to book the day off for the exam, shame really.

However things have changed, I'm starting somewhere new and have promised myself that I'd get that exam out of the way before I start at the new place.

So the date is set for next week and I'll be hitting the books from here till then, wish me luck; I really hope I pass this.


John.
