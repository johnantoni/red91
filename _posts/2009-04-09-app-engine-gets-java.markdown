big plus to java developers, Google App Engine's getting [JAVA support](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10214428-2.html); along with some extra features.

Going to try getting thin + sinatra on my Joyent Shared Accelerator, had it for a couple of years.

Did some more work with plugins, both [matilda](http://github.com/indiehead/matilda/tree/master) and her evil cousin [hatchet_harry](http://github.com/indiehead/hatchet_harry/tree/master) are less hungry in the memory stakes, still got some way to go but getting there.
