Ok, by now i'm reckoning your getting a little tired of using phpMySQL to add and edit your database tables?

So help is on the way for you Mac users with the aptly named <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/">CocoaMySQL</a>.

This provides you with a friendly and OSX-like MySQL GUI for manipulating your MySQL databases, tables, queries, and the lot under the MAC OSX operating system.

It's free and can be downloaded <a href="http://cocoamysql.sourceforge.net/download.php">here</a>.

Enjoy, till next time,

"Good night and good luck"
