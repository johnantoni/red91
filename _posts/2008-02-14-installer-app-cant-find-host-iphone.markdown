If you're one of those guys with a hacked iPhone, you might get this error with the InstallerApp, nothing serious, just one of the repositories has changed location.

#### New Repository Location

* Go to *Sources* in Installer.app.
* Tap the *Edit* button. Click on the *-* icon over *Ste Packaging* source line to delete it.
* Tap the *Add* button and type the right new URL for STE Packaging source:
* Type in the new location.. **http://repo.smxy.org/iphone-apps/**

#### Getting Extra Space on your iPhone

PS, It's recommend you install both *Community Sources* and *BossTool* (in the *Utilities* category) and run the *Free Disk Space* tool inside *BossTool* in order to relocate Fonts, Ringtones and Applications to the main disk partition and thus, be able to install a lot more applications without space problems. 

Note: do this in the recommended order; 

* first Fonts
* then Ringtones 
* and Applications at the last

As always, be careful with this; haven't done it myself btw.

#### Update

Just ran the BossTool on my iphone (1.1.4) and it worked fine, did each in order fonts, then ringtones, then apps.

Also try using ZiPhone to update and unlock your iphone, you should get the new sources in the installer automatically with it.
