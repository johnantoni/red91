Found this out after a chat with Customer Services...

Basically whenever you change your payment details on the iTunes store they make a test charge to the card.  Now if you're using a Debit Card there's a good chance your Bank will flag it up as a fraudulent transaction and put a hold on the card, however if you're using a Credit Card, like MasterCard, the test will go thru fine and you'll be ok.

So as a word of warning, never use a Debit Card for iTunes payments, in fact never use one for online payments at all as it's very hard (nigh impossible) to get the money back once they've taken it; it's practically a go-down-to-the-police-station-job.

The smart move is to sign-up for a Credit Card and pay it off before the end of each month (via direct-debit).

...Also MasterCard is better than VISA I've found, places like BestBuy and the Apple Store have a history of rejecting VISA cards  IMHO.

...Also any purchases at the Apple store have a habit of getting tagged as fraudulent transactions, they apparently get targeted alot as their such a big target.

Hope this helps.
