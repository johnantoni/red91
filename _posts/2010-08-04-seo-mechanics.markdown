After reading _Aaron Walter's_ book __'Building Findable Websites'__ I wanted to put together an article using some of it's findings, what follows is not a definite guide to moulding search-friendly markup but I hope something to whet your appetite.

One thing that seems obvious is it's hard to write good searchable content, just placing words down on a page and filling them with meaningless metadata isn't going to boost your rankings, you really have to focus on what your trying to deliver and stay on that road.

Something you could try is to evaluate what the site you're pushing is trying to sell, is it hair dryers, washing machines, iphones, or knowledge, write it down and take lots of notes.  Get out of the office and brainstorm, observe and try to grasp what it is that makes a person want to visit your site.  Use mind-maps to visualise what you've got to work with and how your audience thinks.

With that information at hand start to build a persona of your typical customer, what is it they want out of your site, what drives their need to consume your goods? is it luxury, a sense of status, reliable and trustworthy content, fresh inspiration.  Start with a basic overview and as time progresses build upon it.

Now you've got that captured you can compare it with the content you are producing and see what does and doesn't make sense. If something looks too long-winded and drawn out then chances are your customers will think the same, so mark that as a problem area.  Segment relevant content into specific categories, tag your content and always include ALT tags to images to help screen readers and search engines alike.  With the content you're producing identify keywords that match potential search terms and begin to create related and relevant content.

# Tips

* Web Standards are your friends, employ them well and you'll be onto a winner.
* The latest HTML5 elements can also allow you to better compose the structure of your site, header, footer, article, they're all good.
* Image Tag use: _If the visual content is not informational, all imagery should be presented via CSS_
* URLs: _Everything after the question mark of a URL is ignored by search engines, make URLs predictable to users_
* Use microformats where possible to enrich your content, newer devices are able to read off these and consume their data (see hcard's).  Instead of providing an address use an hcard to add flavour to the markup.

# Meta Tags

* Keywords in your meta-content must be relevant, there's no need filling your meta with meaningless words if they do not relate to the actual content on the page.  Fulfil this well and your visitors will be pleased.
* The ROBOTs tag is unneccesary these days, bots will crawl your site regardless.  However if you feel like leaving a url to your sitemap in the robots.txt it wouldn't hurt.
* Avoid META REFRESH like the plague, just a bad idea.
* Always include CONTENT-TYPE, just good practice.

# Optional Meta

* AUTHOR
* CONTENT-LANGUAGE ~ allows you to provide multi-lingual alternatives (english meta description, german meta description) for your visitors.
* COPYRIGHT ~ for obvious legal reasons
* GEO-TAG ~ give them the ability to find your shop when they're on an iPhone, etc.

# ALT Tags

* When choosing the alternative text for images consider shortening the description and increasing it's keyword density, bots will then be able to search and highlight those elements based on it's relevance to the query and connecting it to the keywords already employed on the page will highten it's chances of being found.
* If you have to use long descriptions on images, use the LONGDESC attribute.  Alternatively you could use something like "#footnote2" to link it to a more detailed explanation on the page.
* Use ACRONYM or ABBR to describe acronym's, e.g. ~ "...title='georgia'>GA<" .
