<blockquote>Cold readers commonly employ high probability guesses about the subject, quickly picking up on signals from their subjects as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not, and then emphasizing and reinforcing any chance connections the subjects acknowledge while quickly moving on from missed guesses.</blockquote>

Everyday each one of us is subjected to a constant bombardment of information, opinions, sounds and mental programming; most of the time without us even noticing what's going on.  However, if you turn around and look at everything in a different light, studying what's going on and asking why as loud as you can, you can pick up so much information things might become a little clearer in that hazy and very weird thing called life.

Think of adverts on tv, there's that particular one with the band you love, maybe Muse and you just have to hang around till it finishes; the advertisers know this so while you're mind is on other things they've got you to plug their product.  It's crafty, but it does work, and in many cases that Nationwide mortgage or JML mop really was a good purchase.  There are a billion other techniques and in the most sense it's all about a good ad campaign, if you put the right amount of effort into something the returns can be endless.

Same thing with ideas, if you go out today and have a look around I'm sure your bound to see or experience some kind of problem or fault that hinders others and you know just needs that extra bit to be perfect.  It's the essence of being an entrepreneur, going out and fixing something for the greater good, not necessarily for the money.

Someone famous once told me, "first create something to solve a problem, the money will come later" trust me, if the ideas sound enough you won't have a problem with the money; it's just getting that first spark of inspiration to do it that's the clincher.  Look at your job, did you say yes because of the money or what you'd be doing, 90% of the time it'll be the task; passion to do something is what drives us and feeds us in those long hours of darkness.

Take care out there.


John,
