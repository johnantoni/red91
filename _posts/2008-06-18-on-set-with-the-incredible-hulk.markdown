Just came out after seeing The Incredible Hulk, starring Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, and it certainly brings back memories from our holiday in Toronto Canada last year.  

Culver [Toronto] University, the Bioligy University and more importantly that time when we were walking thru the PATH (Toronto's pedestrian network) and walking onto that so-called 'Critical Incident' set.

I can remember us walking thru those turnstyle doors, American Eagle shopping bags and my fiancee Michelle in-tow, then being presented with that dramatic scene outside.  In front of us stood the large dome entrance flanked to the left by a New York fire truck, to our right the NYPD; with the building in front flanked by US Army troops armed to the teeth, guns going off and a director screaming to get us off set.  

The blurb was that they were filming a pilot for some new US crime tv series called 'Critical Incident' similar to CSI, in reality after seeing the finished product it was in fact the newly realised Incredible Hulk.  The scene in question is where the abomination is created, a real freak of nature and bad medicine and a total headache for our hero Bruce Banner.

One guess which ED it is, and no it's not the horse ;-)

Ok, these aren't the best of shots but it does prove Toronto's one amazing city and home to some of the nicest people; plus it's cheaper to shoot there than NY.  So on that note, let's have a stroll around to see what other delights can be seen in the film.

Doubling up as big green's home.  Toronto University is an awesome sight to behold and has been used in many other films (Good Will Hunting), the architecture and history embedded within these walls has brought us such things as the first pacemaker, the chemical laser and the extraction of insulin.  

It's actually broken up into several blocks and is home to some of the brightest minds on the planet, with regular features in Newsweek.

Strolling thru campus crossing Queens Park, it's such a relaxing place to visit but really needs a good day to explore thoroughly.  

If you wander you may see Leslie Nielsen's photo on one of the buildings, he studied at Lorne Greene's Academy of Radio Arts before winning a scholarship to New York.

The huge Robards library is built in the shape of a peacock, and stands 14 story's high; housing rare works and first editions it provides the facilities for young minds to take flight.
