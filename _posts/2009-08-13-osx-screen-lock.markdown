Handy little tip courtesy of [What Do I Know](http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/000957.shtml)

* Fire up the **Keychain Access** utility
* Goto ...Preferences -> General
* Tick "Show Status in Menu Bar"

An open Pad Lock will appear on your menubar window, now every time you need to lock your screen you can do so thru the Pad Lock
