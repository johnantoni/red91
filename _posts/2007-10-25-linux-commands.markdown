Here's some useful commands to keep things running in check on your linux box; apt-get (ubuntu), aptitude (debian).

* *apt-get update* ...update software repository  db
* *apt-get upgrade* ...install software updates
* *apt-get clean* ...clear old software caches


Use *aptitude clean* on a debian linux system and the other appropriate commands to do the same.

Also i'd suggest buying the book '*Linux Phrasebook*' from Amazon, very useful.
