Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows. It consists of two parts:

* A DLL (cygwin1.dll) which acts as a Linux API emulation layer providing substantial Linux API functionality.
* A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel.

If you're a Rails developer on Windows you may need this little tool, so install it from...

* [Installer](http://cygwin.com/setup.exe)
