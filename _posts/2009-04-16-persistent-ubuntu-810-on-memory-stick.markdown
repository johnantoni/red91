There's a limit to the size of memory stick you can use if you're going to boot & run Linux using a FAT16 partition of 2048mb (2gb).  But using this tutorial you can get around it.

* [Ubuntu 8.10 on 2GB+ USB Stick](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ubuntu-810-persistent-flash-drive-install-from-live-cd/)

Mind you looking at things Fedora 10 on a Live USB disk looks very do-able, especially with the Live USB Creator, may try [that](http://spins.fedoraproject.org/) out first.

Will try this out when my 32GB stick arrives and post back with the results.
