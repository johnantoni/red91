title: Set Default App for File Types in OSX
category: apple

Needed to change the default app used for all my text files over to TextMate, there's a slow way (right-click, set default, repeat) or a quicker way by using a tool called **Rubicode - RCDefaultApp**.

Once [installed](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/) this adds an extra item to your **System Preferences** pane to set which program to open per file extensions, url, etc. simply and quickly in one dialog pane.

Just download the archive, open **System Preferences** then drag the **.prefpane** file into the panel and you're done.  Simple free and easy to use, it solves another hole in OSX's armor.

Enjoy.
