One of the major milestones with building any enterprise-level web application is finding a way to authenticate your users and make sure only logged-in users get access to your system's heart.

As you've probably experienced with other platforms there are many ways to do this, NT Authentication with Internet Information Server (IIS) and the .NET framework, PGP encryption libraries, etc. but the one common factor is that 9 times out of 10 the skeletal structure doesn't exist and so with each incarnation you have to reinvent the wheel; so to speak.

This is where Ruby on Rails is different, and proves quite effectively it's support network and massive user base.

Take a look at the below links, I think you'll find them pretty interesting...
