#### Movie Notes

Eighty percent of movies are made from books, contact a publisher to get their pre-release catalogue and get in there first-hand. 

Note, big studio's have deals with the bigger publishers so they may usually have the latest stories before it hits the book-sellers.  However there's always a chance they overlook the best ideas.

Also try to contact agents in the media, they may have a film or short work they need produced; offer to do it as a favour.

One of the main faults in shooting a short-film is finding the best location for recording sound, so many good ideas have been ruined by overlooking this fundamental element.

#### Script Writing

Write spec scripts, find literary agents, contact the Film Council.

A good short-film script has a good one-page synopsis and averages 90-100 pages.  Has a good layout, structure.  It's quick, fast and doesn't have many long complicated scene set-ups.
