##### Introduction

**Matilda** is my own hack at a blogging engine, parts i'm not particularly proud of but it works, it's fast and it hasn't bork'd at me yet.

So far it sports,

* RSS / ATOM Feed generation for Articles & Pages
* Ping Support (Google Sitemap + Pingomatic)
* Twitter Support
* JQuery for the interface
* Simple Admin system
* Search on Blog + Admin
* Comment Approval
* Akismet Spam protection (you'll need a wordpress key for that)
* 100% working Typo to Matilda Importer
* Page Caching + Sweeper Scripts

Still tweaking the code but it's a fun little app.

##### Update

I've recently converted it into a Rails Engine, this is now available along with detailed installation instructions here:

* [Matilda GitHub Repository](http://github.com/indiehead/matilda/tree/master)

Let me know if you get problems,

##### Matilda ?

My fiancee's was a little obsessed with Heath Ledger, after he passed away I thought it a fitting tribute to name something after him.  Michelle suggested naming it 'Matilda' in honor of his daughter with any donations going to his charity.

All the best,


John.
